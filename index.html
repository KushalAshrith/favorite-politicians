            <summary>NARENDRA MODI</summary>
        
            <P>Narendra Modi is an Indian politician serving as the 14th Prime Minister of India since May 2014. He was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat, India. Before his tenure as Prime Minister, Modi served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014.

            Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organization. He joined the RSS at a young age and later became involved in politics. 
            
            During his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi implemented several developmental projects, attracting investment to the state and earning praise for his administration's economic policies. However, his time as Chief Minister was also marred by controversy, particularly regarding the handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which resulted in significant criticism of his government's response.
            
            As Prime Minister, Modi has focused on various initiatives including "Make in India" to boost manufacturing, "Digital India" to promote technology, "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" for cleanliness, and "Skill India" to enhance employment opportunities. His government also launched demonetization in 2016, a controversial move aimed at combating corruption and black money.
            
            Modi's tenure has been marked by both praise and criticism. Supporters credit him with implementing economic reforms and infrastructure development projects, while critics raise concerns about issues such as religious polarization, freedom of speech, and human rights violations.

            <summary>KCR</summary>
            <p>
                K. Chandrashekar Rao, popularly known as KCR, is an Indian politician and the founder of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party. Born on February 17, 1954, in Chintamadaka village, Telangana, Rao began his political career in the 1970s as a youth activist involved in the Telangana movement, advocating for a separate state for the Telangana region. In 2001, he resigned from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and founded the TRS with the primary objective of achieving statehood for Telangana. Rao played a pivotal role in the formation of the state of Telangana, which was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, and he became its first Chief Minister. Under his leadership, the TRS has won consecutive elections in Telangana, consolidating its position as the dominant political force in the state. KCR is known for his populist policies and focus on welfare schemes, including the Rythu Bandhu scheme providing financial assistance to farmers, and the KCR Kit initiative providing essential items to newborns and mothers. However, his government has also faced criticism for issues such as unemployment and the state's fiscal deficit. Despite this, KCR remains a significant figure in Telangana politics, wielding considerable influence over the state's political landscape.
                K. Chandrashekar Rao, widely known as KCR, is an influential Indian politician who has made a significant mark on the political landscape of the southern state of Telangana. Born on February 17, 1954, in Chintamadaka village of Telangana, Rao's political journey began in his early years as he actively participated in the Telangana movement, advocating for the rights of the region and its people.

                KCR's political career gained momentum in the 1970s when he became associated with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) under the leadership of N.T. Rama Rao. He held various positions within the party before eventually rising to prominence as a vocal advocate for the separate statehood of Telangana.
                
                In 2001, disillusioned with the TDP's stance on Telangana, KCR resigned from the party and founded the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) with the sole objective of achieving statehood for Telangana. The TRS quickly gained traction as the voice of Telangana's aspirations, spearheading the movement for a separate state.
                
                KCR's leadership was instrumental in the formation of Telangana as India's 29th state in 2014, following decades of agitation and political maneuvering. With the formation of the new state, KCR assumed office as its first Chief Minister, leading the TRS to a landslide victory in the state's inaugural elections.
                
                As Chief Minister, KCR implemented several welfare schemes and development programs aimed at improving the lives of Telangana's citizens. The Rythu Bandhu scheme, which provides financial assistance to farmers, and the KCR Kit initiative, offering essential items to newborns and mothers, are among his flagship programs.
                
                Under KCR's leadership, Telangana has witnessed significant infrastructure development, including the construction of irrigation projects and the expansion of urban areas. His administration has also focused on industrial growth and attracting investment to the state, contributing to Telangana's economic progress.
                
                Despite his achievements, KCR's tenure has not been without criticism. The TRS government has faced scrutiny over issues such as unemployment, agrarian distress, and the state's fiscal deficit. Additionally, some opposition parties have accused KCR of authoritarianism and dynastic politics, particularly concerning the prominence of his family members within the TRS.
                
                Nevertheless, KCR's influence in Telangana politics remains formidable, with the TRS maintaining a stronghold in the state and KCR himself emerging as a prominent regional leader on the national stage. His strategic political maneuvers and populist policies continue to shape the trajectory of Telangana's development and political landscape.

            <p>

Born on November 18, 1979, in Karur, Tamil Nadu, Annamalai pursued a career in the Indian Police Service (IPS) after completing his education. He gained recognition for his distinguished service and leadership within the police force.

Annamalai's tenure as an IPS officer saw him serve in various capacities across different regions of India, including as the Superintendent of Police (SP) in Karkala, Udupi District, Karnataka. He earned a reputation for his strict enforcement of the law and efforts to combat crime and corruption.

In 2019, Annamalai took voluntary retirement from the IPS, citing personal reasons and a desire to pursue public service through politics. He joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with the aim of bringing about positive change and development in Tamil Nadu.

Annamalai's entry into politics marked a significant shift in Tamil Nadu's political landscape, particularly as he sought to challenge established parties and ideologies. He has been vocal about issues such as governance, law enforcement, and youth empowerment, positioning himself as a dynamic and reform-minded leader.

Annamalai's political journey gained momentum as he actively campaigned for the BJP in Tamil Nadu, advocating for the party's vision and principles. His background as a former police officer and his commitment to transparency and accountability resonated with many voters, especially those disillusioned with traditional politics.

While Annamalai's political career is still evolving, his entry into the arena has injected new energy and ideas into Tamil Nadu's political discourse. As he continues to engage with constituents and work towards his vision for the state, Annamalai remains a figure to watch in the realm of Tamil Nadu politics, with the potential to influence its trajectory in the years to come.
